  <h1>Registration</h1>

  <h2>Step 1: Sign up</h2>
  <p>Before signing up make sure you read the
  <a href="http://www.smokeyfeet.com/terms/" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a>
  and <a href="http://www.smokeyfeet.com/workshop/levels/" target="_blank">level descriptions</a>
  to see which level suits you best.
  </p>

  <p>A lead and follow can sign up as a couple for the workshop (full pass).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Both lead and follow need to sign up for the same level and on the same day</li>
    <li>You can not sign up with someone who's already registered alone</li>
    <li>Both of you need to mention your partner's name on the sign up form</li>
  </ul>

  <p>After signing up you will receive an email confirming we've received
  your signup details. <b>This means we received your registration
  and does not mean you have secured a spot</b>. If this doesn't happen
  contact us!
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: Wait for confirmation</h2>

  <p>Your registration is initially put on hold until we can confirm that
  we can offer you a spot. Once a spot opens up you will receive an
  email. In this email you'll find a link to a questionnaire and payment
  information. We hope to send out the first confirmations within a week
  after registration opens.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: Complete your registration</h2>

  <p>You have 14 days to complete your payment, fill in the questionnaire
  and send in your video audition (if applicable) or your reserved spot
  will be canceled. You should receive a final email confirming your
  successful registration.
  </p>

  <p><i>PIANO level: If you send your video audition, you will get an email
  with the information regarding your level placement.</i>
  </p>

  <p><i>Note: It is possible to cancel or transfer your ticket. Check the
  Terms and Conditions for more info.</i>
