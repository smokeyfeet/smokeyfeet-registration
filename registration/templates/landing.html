  <h1>Smokey Feet 2016 Registration</h1>

  <h2>Before the registration</h2>

  <p>Before signing up make sure you read the
  terms &amp; conditions and level descriptions to
  see which level suits you best.
  </p>

  <h2>Sign up</h2>
  <p>You should receive an automatically generated message after your
  registration (note: this means we received your registration
  and does not mean you are accepted to the workshop). If this doesn't
  happen contact us!
  </p>

  <h2>Wait for confirmation and payment info</h2>
  Your registration is initially put on hold until we can confirm that
  we can offer you a spot. Once a spot opens up you will receive an
  email. In this email you’ll find a link to a questionnaire and payment
  information. We hope to send out the first confirmations within a week
  after the registration opens.
  </p>

  <h2>Complete your registration</h2>
  <p>You have 14 days to complete your payment, fill in the questionnaire
  and send in your video audition (if applicable), or your reserved spot
  will be cancelled. You should receive a final email confirming your
  successful registration.
  </p>

  <h1>Important need-to-knows</h1>

  <h2>Signing up with a partner</h2>
  <p>A lead and follow can sign up as a couple. Note that both
  of you need to sign up for the same level and you can not sign
  up with someone who’s already registered alone. Both of you
  need to mention your partner’s name during registration. Signing
  up with a partner is the best way to secure a spot for the workshop.
  </p>

  <p>If you send your video audition, you will get an email with
  the information regarding which level you are accepted in.
  </p>

  <p>It is possible to cancel or transfer your ticket. Check our
  Terms and Conditions for more info.
