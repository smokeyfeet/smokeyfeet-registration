<h3>Video Audition</h3>
<p>You've signed up for a workshop pass that <strong>requires a video
audition</strong>. It should be a video of you social dancing, no routines
allowed. If it's a video of a Jack and Jill or a video with more people in it,
please let us know who you are to prevent confusion :). As far as tempos: mid-
to high-tempo songs are required.</p>

<p>To make it a bit more fun we added a challenge this year. There will be a
prize for the most original video audition. To give you ideas: record your
video in a weird location or add your best Halloween outfit.</p>

<p>Please upload your video audition to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> and mail us
(<a href="mailto:info@smokeyfeet.com">info@smokeyfeet.com</a>) the shareable
link. Make sure we receive your video before
{{ registration.video_audition_due_date|date:"SHORT_DATE_FORMAT" }}.
We will respond as soon as possible to let you know in which level you are.
